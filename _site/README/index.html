<h1>The personal website of Martin Dawson</h1>
<p>I want this to be a place that links to projects and other websites that I've made, and also allows people to find me on social networks and by email.</p>
<h1>Compiling the Tailwind CSS</h1>
<p>CSS uses Tailwind, and the command to process it is:</p>
<pre><code>npx tailwindcss build tailwind/source.css -o assets/css/main.css
</code></pre>
<p>This is mainly the styling for the Markdown CSS... most other elements are styled using utility classes in HTML.</p>
