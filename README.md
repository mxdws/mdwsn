# The personal website of Martin Dawson

I want this to be a place that links to projects and other websites that I've made, and also allows people to find me on social networks and by email.

# Compiling the Tailwind CSS

CSS uses Tailwind, and the command to process it is:

    npx tailwindcss build tailwind/source.css -o assets/css/main.css

This is mainly the styling for the Markdown CSS... most other elements are styled using utility classes in HTML.
